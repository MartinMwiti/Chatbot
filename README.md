# Chatbot

## What is Chatbot? 

* A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) software that can simulate a conversation (or a chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications, websites, mobile apps or through the telephone.

* #### There are two basic types of chatbot models based on how they are built; Retrieval based and Generative based models.

## 1. Retrieval based Chatbots
* A retrieval-based chatbot uses predefined input patterns and responses. It then uses some type of heuristic approach to select the appropriate response.

## 2. Generative based Chatbots
* Generative models are not based on some predefined responses.

* They are based on seq 2 seq neural networks. It is the same idea as machine translation. In machine translation, we translate the source code from one language to another language but here, we are going to transform input into an output. It needs a large amount of data and it is based on Deep Neural networks.
